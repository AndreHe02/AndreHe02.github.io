I'm a second-year Ph.D. student in the Language Technologies Institute at CMU, co-advised by Prof. [Sean Welleck](https://wellecks.com/) and Prof. [Daniel Fried](https://dpfried.github.io/). Before coming to CMU, I completed my undergraduate studies at UC Berkeley. I had the privilege of working with [Nicholas Tomlin](https://nickatomlin.github.io/) and Prof. Dan Klein in the [Berkeley NLP Group](https://nlp.cs.berkeley.edu/) and with [Kuan Fang](https://kuanfang.github.io/) and Prof. Sergey Levine in [RAIL](https://rail.eecs.berkeley.edu/). More recently, I completed an internship at AWS, where I was mentored by [Nathaniel Weir](https://nweir127.github.io/) and [Kaj Bostrom](https://bostromk.net/).

My research interests lie in Reasoning and Reinforcement Learning. Iâ€™m particularly interested in how "intelligent behaviors" emerge, and what forms they take, when interacting with environments such as games, mathematics, and discourse (e.g. trying to convince a reader). 

My most recent work was on reinforcement learning for theorem proving, and I am currently exploring the potential for inference scaling in text diffusion models. In the past, I have worked on language-conditioned robotics, interpretability, and computational linguistics.
